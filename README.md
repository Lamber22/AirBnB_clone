## Repository Description

 This is a complete web application, that has database storage, a front -end and a back-end API of Airbnb.

 For this project, we will be using the console as our front-end for the purpose of building the back-end.

 This consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.
